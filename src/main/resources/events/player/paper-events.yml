    #           - This level of monitoring records literally all possible information you could find in event that includes:
    #               - All possible information about item player used.
    #               - All possible information about interacted block.
    #               - All possible information about Biome event happened.
    #               - All possible information about Chunk event happened.
    #               - There are about 18 more details I don't event want to write here
    #               - In some events It may be even possible that recorded data may reach 1 GB of weight
    #           - It's highly not recommended to ever use this level.
